🎯This is the starting of my DSA journey.

👉Why DS?
Data structure is simply a way to store and organize information appropriately ,
so that it can be used efficiently.

👉Advantages of DS:
1) Easier processing of data.
2) Efficient functioning of computer software since the data is stored in an efficient way.

👉Categories of DS(based on how they can be accessed):
1️⃣ Linear DS: These DS can be accessed sequentially by visiting each element in the
array and commonly referred to as PASSOVER.
example: Arrays,LL,Stack,Queue.
2️⃣ Non-Linear DS: These DS stores the data in sorted way where there is a relationship
between elements.We can't access the data sequentially but accessing the data requires
ADVANCING and BACKTRACKING over the bits of data.
example: Tress and Graph

👉Categories of DS(based on how they can be stored):
1️⃣ Linear DS: Elements are stored consecutively in the memory.
example: Arrays
2️⃣ Non-Linear DS: Elements are stored randomly and each bit of data has a pointer location
of the next element.
example: LinkedLists
Everything else is depends upon the impl.
